    narrative: `It's Sunday afternoon, and I've been on the couch for six hours.

The TV hums in the background—something I've seen before, requiring nothing from me. The snacks are arranged within arm's reach: chips, cookies, the good cheese I save for weekends. My phone is across the room, where I put it so I wouldn't have to see the notifications.

*This is self-care,* I tell myself. *I worked hard this week. I deserve to rest.*

But somewhere beneath the pleasant numbness, something is stirring. A small voice I've gotten very good at drowning out.

*You're not resting. You're hiding.*

I turn up the TV and reach for another cookie. The voice quiets. This is the deal I've made: stay comfortable enough, and the uncomfortable things stay away.

It works. Mostly.

My sister called twice this week about our mother's health. I texted back "thinking of you" but didn't call. There's a conversation we need to have—about care options, about money, about what happens next—and every time I approach it, I find myself suddenly very tired.

*Tomorrow. I'll deal with it tomorrow.*

Tomorrow has been happening for three months.

The sun is setting outside my window. I haven't been outside today. Haven't showered. Haven't done anything that requires more energy than existing. The comfort I've cultivated feels less like a nest now and more like quicksand—the more I sink in, the harder it is to move.

*What am I so afraid of?*

The question arrives despite my best efforts to keep it out. I sit with it, uncomfortable for the first time all day.

I think about my childhood home, where peace meant no one was fighting. Where my parents' marriage was a cold war, and my role was to be easy—no demands, no conflicts, no trouble. I learned that the way to survive was to disappear into the background, to want nothing that might disrupt the fragile equilibrium.

*I'm still doing it. Disappearing into comfort so I don't have to exist.*

The realization is unwelcome. I reach for the chips, but my hand stops halfway. I've been numbing myself to avoid feeling, but I'm also numbing myself to avoid living. The same comfort that protects me from pain also protects me from joy, from connection, from meaning.

*What would it feel like to want something?*

The question is terrifying. I've spent so long not-wanting that I don't even know what my desires are. They've been buried under decades of accommodation and numbness.

I turn off the TV. The silence is startling.

I pick up my phone. The notifications are there: my sister, three friends, a reminder about a life I've been avoiding.

I call my sister.

"Hey," she says, surprised. "I didn't expect to hear from you."

"I know. I'm sorry. I've been... hiding." The words feel strange in my mouth. Honest. "Can we talk about Mom? For real this time?"

The conversation is hard. There are decisions to make, feelings to feel, conflicts to navigate. Everything I've been avoiding. But as I sit there, actually present for once, I notice something: I'm not dying. The discomfort isn't killing me. It's just discomfort.

After we hang up, I shower. Get dressed. Walk outside into the evening air. The world is still there, still turning, still asking something of me.

I don't know how to want things yet. I don't know how to show up fully for my own life. But I'm standing outside now, feeling the breeze, and that's something.

The couch will still be there tomorrow. But maybe I don't have to live on it.

Maybe I can be uncomfortable sometimes.

Maybe that's what being alive actually feels like.`,

    narrative: `The book club meeting has been going for two hours, and I've agreed with everyone.

"I thought the ending was perfect," said Martha. I nodded enthusiastically.

"I thought the ending was rushed," said Patricia. I nodded with equal conviction. "You make a good point."

Now they're debating, and I'm smiling and contributing nothing, because I genuinely cannot remember what I thought about the ending. Did I think anything? Or was I too busy tracking everyone else's reactions to form my own?

*What do I actually think?*

The question floats up and I push it down, the way I always do. It doesn't matter what I think—what matters is that the group is happy, that no one is fighting, that I belong.

"You've been quiet, Linda," Patricia says. "What's your take?"

All eyes turn to me. The familiar panic rises—the spotlight I've spent my life avoiding.

"I think you both make great points," I hear myself say. "I can see it both ways."

Patricia frowns. "But what do YOU think?"

The room waits. I search for an opinion—any opinion—and find only the echoes of everyone else's. I've been so busy merging with the group that I've lost track of my own perspective.

"I... I'm not sure," I admit finally. "I think I need to think about it."

The moment passes. The conversation moves on. But something has shifted in me—a small crack in the pleasant fog I usually live in.

Driving home, I try an experiment: I turn off the radio. Usually I fill silence with podcasts, audiobooks, other people's thoughts to think. But tonight, I drive in quiet.

*Who am I when I'm not participating?*

The question is uncomfortable. I've built my entire life around groups—book clubs, volunteer organizations, community boards. I tell myself I'm a joiner, a connector, someone who brings people together. But am I connecting, or am I disappearing?

I think about last Thanksgiving, when my family asked where I wanted to go for dinner. "Whatever everyone else wants," I said—and I meant it. I genuinely didn't have a preference. My wanting-mechanism has atrophied from decades of disuse.

*When did I stop being a person and start being a participant?*

At home, I sit in my living room without turning on the TV. Without calling anyone. Without doing anything that involves a group.

It's excruciating. The silence feels like a void, and without other people to orient around, I feel formless. Dissolved.

*Maybe that's the problem. Maybe I've been using groups to give me a shape I don't have on my own.*

I get a piece of paper and try to write down things I like. Not things my friends like, not things the group approves of—things I, Linda, actually enjoy.

The pen hovers. For a long time, nothing comes.

Then, slowly: "The smell of rain. Spicy food—hotter than anyone else wants. True crime documentaries that Martha thinks are trashy. Sleeping in on Saturdays instead of volunteering."

The list is small. Some of it feels like betrayal—admitting I don't want to volunteer, that I have preferences that might conflict with the group's.

But it's mine. For the first time in longer than I can remember, it's mine.

I don't know how to be a person separate from my groups. I don't know how to have opinions that might cause conflict. But I'm holding this list, these small preferences, and they feel like seeds.

Tomorrow, at book club, someone will ask what I think.

Maybe this time, I'll tell them.

Even if no one agrees.`,

    narrative: `James is deciding what we should have for dinner, and I'm watching his face like it holds the answers to the universe.

"I'm thinking Thai," he says. "Unless you want something else?"

*Do I want something else?* I search inside for a preference and find only the familiar emptiness—the place where my desires should be, occupied instead by attentiveness to his.

"Thai sounds perfect," I say. Because it does. Because whatever he wants sounds perfect. Because I've spent three years becoming so attuned to this man that I've forgotten how to want things independently.

This is love, right? This merging?

Later, at the restaurant, I order what I know he thinks I should try. I laugh at the jokes I know he wants me to find funny. I am the perfect complement to him—agreeable, harmonious, complete.

But in the bathroom mirror, I catch a glimpse of someone I barely recognize. When did my face start looking so... vague? So uncertain of its own features?

*Who are you?*

The question rattles me. I grip the sink and try to remember what I was like before James. What I wanted. What I thought. But it's like trying to remember a dream—the harder I grasp, the faster it dissolves.

I met James at a difficult time. I was lost, directionless, unsure who I was or what I wanted from life. He was certain. Grounded. He knew what he liked, what he believed, where he was going.

So I merged with him. Not consciously—it happened naturally, the way water fills a container. His opinions became my opinions. His friends became my friends. His life became my life.

*I stopped existing and started orbiting.*

The realization is nauseating. I love James—I really do. But somewhere along the way, love became erasure. I stopped being a person and became a moon, reflecting his light, invisible when he looks away.

I go back to the table. James is talking about his day, and I'm nodding, and everything is peaceful and harmonious and utterly, terrifyingly empty.

"Can I tell you something?" I interrupt.

He looks surprised. I don't usually interrupt.

"I don't know who I am anymore," I say. The words come out shaky. "I think I've been disappearing into you. Into us. I don't know what I want for dinner—I really don't know. I don't know what I think about anything. I've been borrowing your self because I couldn't find my own."

The silence stretches. I've never been this honest—it feels like violence, like disruption, like everything I've spent my life avoiding.

"I've noticed," he says quietly. "I didn't know how to say it."

The admission cracks something open. He saw me disappearing and didn't know how to stop it. Maybe he didn't want to stop it—having a partner who always agrees is comfortable. But it's also lonely, loving someone who isn't fully there.

"I need to figure out who I am," I say. "Separate from you. Not because I don't love you, but because I can't keep being nobody."

He takes my hand. "What do you actually want for dinner?"

The question is simple and impossible. I sit with it, resisting the urge to scan his face for clues.

"I don't know," I finally say. "But I want to find out."

We leave the restaurant and walk in silence. For the first time, I'm not merging—I'm walking beside him, a separate person with uncertain edges, trying to figure out what I want.

It's uncomfortable. Lonely. Real.

But at least it's me.

Whoever that turns out to be.`,
