    narrative: `The fever has been climbing for three days.

I know I should call someone. Go to a doctor. But every time I reach for my phone, something stops me. A voice that says: *You don't need help. You've survived worse. This is nothing.*

I curl tighter under the blankets, shivering. The apartment is quiet—I live alone, by design. The walls are lined with books I've collected, art that speaks to my soul, objects that prove I have good taste even if I have no one to share it with.

*This is fine. I prefer it this way.*

The lie is so familiar I barely notice it anymore. Of course I prefer isolation. Of course I don't need the messiness of other people, their obligations and expectations and disappointments. I am self-contained. I am enough.

My phone lights up. Message from Sarah: "Haven't heard from you in a week. You okay?"

I type: "Just busy. Talk soon." Send. The dismissal is automatic—protecting both of us from the vulnerability of her actually helping.

The truth? I haven't been busy. I've been lying here, sick and alone, too proud to admit I need something I can't provide for myself.

*Asking for help means being a burden. Being a burden means being abandoned.*

There it is. The core wound, pulsing beneath the fever. I learned young that needs were dangerous—that showing weakness invited rejection. So I became the person who needs nothing. The one who endures. The stoic.

But lying here in the dark, body aching, too dizzy to make tea, I see the cost of this armor. I see how my self-sufficiency is also self-abandonment. I see how my dignity is also prison.

*What if I just... asked?*

The thought makes me nauseous, and not just from the fever. Asking feels like dying. Like admitting a fundamental defect, proving that I was right all along—I'm not enough.

I lie there for another hour, negotiating with myself. Finally, hands shaking, I type a different message to Sarah:

"Actually, I'm pretty sick. Could you maybe bring some soup?"

I stare at the words. They look pathetic. Weak. Everything I've spent thirty-seven years not being.

I send it anyway.

The minutes stretch. I've made a terrible mistake. She'll see how needy I really am. She'll pull away, the way everyone eventually does when they glimpse what's beneath my composure.

My phone buzzes. "Oh no! Of course. Be there in 20. Hang in there."

Something cracks in my chest—not the illness, something deeper. Something that's been frozen for decades.

When Sarah arrives, she doesn't look at me with pity or disgust. She just heats up soup, puts fresh water by my bed, and sits with me while I eat.

"Why didn't you call sooner?" she asks.

"I didn't want to be a burden."

"You're my friend, you idiot. Being there for you isn't a burden. It's the point."

I can't respond. If I try to speak, I'll cry, and I don't cry in front of people.

But later, after she's gone, in the dark with the fever finally breaking, I let myself feel it. The grief of all those years spent alone when I didn't have to be. The exhaustion of performing strength I didn't possess. The strange, terrifying relief of being seen as weak and loved anyway.

I don't become a different person overnight. The instinct to isolate, to endure, to refuse help—it's bone-deep. But something has shifted.

Maybe needing people isn't defective.

Maybe the wound I've been hiding was never the problem.

Maybe it was the hiding itself.

I text Sarah: "Thank you. I mean it."

She sends back a heart emoji. Simple. Ordinary. The most extraordinary thing I've received in years.

I fall asleep still fevered but somehow warmer. Tomorrow, I will practice asking again.`,

    narrative: `The party is in full swing, and I'm watching from the corner, cataloging all the ways I don't fit in.

There's Maya, laughing with effortless grace, surrounded by people who adore her. There's Jake, telling a story that has everyone captivated. They move through social space like they were born to it, like belonging is their birthright.

I take a sip of wine and feel the familiar ache settling into my chest. The sense of looking through glass at a world I can see but never enter.

*They don't struggle like this. They don't have this... void.*

I know how I look to them. Mysterious. Artistic. Perhaps intimidatingly deep. I've cultivated the image—the vintage clothes, the obscure references, the meaningful silences. It's armor, but it's also advertisement: *I am not ordinary. My suffering has made me interesting.*

But beneath the performance, there's just pain. The conviction that something is fundamentally wrong with me. That everyone else received an instruction manual for being human, and mine was lost in the mail.

A woman approaches. "I love your style. Very... distinctive."

"Thanks." I manage a small smile, already feeling the interaction slip away. I don't know how to do this—the small talk, the easy connection. Every word feels weighted with the possibility of revealing how broken I am underneath.

She moves on. Of course she does.

I drift to the balcony, where the noise is muffled and I can be alone with my preferred companion: melancholy. The city sprawls below, millions of lives being lived with an ease I'll never know.

*Why do I always feel like I'm watching life through a window?*

Tears prick my eyes. Not dramatic tears—I save those for when they'll be witnessed—but small, private tears. The kind that acknowledge a grief so old it's become part of my skeleton.

Then: "Hey. Mind if I join you?"

I turn. It's a man I don't know, holding a beer, looking slightly awkward himself.

"Sure," I hear myself say.

We stand in silence for a moment. Then he says, "I hate parties."

I almost laugh. "Me too."

"Everyone seems so..." he searches for the word.

"Easy," I offer. "Like they know how to be people."

"Yes. Exactly." He looks at me with surprise and something like recognition. "I feel like I'm always translating myself into a language I don't speak fluently."

The ache in my chest shifts. For a moment—just a moment—I don't feel so alien.

"What if..." I start, then stop. The vulnerability feels dangerous.

"What?"

"What if everyone feels like that? At least a little? And we're all just pretending to be fluent?"

He considers this. "That would be either very comforting or very disturbing."

"Maybe both."

We talk for an hour. He tells me about his divorce, his doubt, his sense of being perpetually on the outside. I tell him about my art, my loneliness, my conviction that I'm fundamentally different from everyone else.

And somewhere in the conversation, I notice something: I'm not performing. I'm not showcasing my suffering or advertising my depth. I'm just... talking. To someone who might actually understand.

"I should go," he says eventually. "But... this was nice. Real."

"Yeah." I realize I mean it. "It was."

He leaves. I stay on the balcony, but something has shifted. The familiar ache is still there, but it's lighter somehow. Like it's been witnessed and, in being witnessed, lost some of its power.

Maybe I'm not as unique in my suffering as I thought. Maybe that's not a loss—maybe it's a door.

I go back inside. The party is still happening, still full of people who seem to belong. But now I see them differently. Maybe they're all performing too. Maybe belonging isn't something you're born with—it's something you build, awkwardly, through moments of actual connection.

I find the man by the door, putting on his coat.

"Would you want to get coffee sometime?" I ask, and my heart pounds with the risk.

He smiles. "I'd like that."

Walking home, I think about how I've made loneliness into an identity. How I've confused being different with being defective. How maybe—just maybe—I don't have to be the outsider forever.

The ache remains. But it's not alone anymore.

Neither am I.`,

    somaticMarker: 'Burning intensity in the solar plexus, sharp heat in the eyes, a magnetic pull toward what you lack',
    hiddenLogic: 'You have what I need to be complete. I hate you for having it. I want to possess it—or destroy it.',
    narrative: `I see her the moment she walks in. Clara. My ex's new girlfriend.

She's everything I'm not: blonde where I'm dark, easy where I'm intense, simple where I'm complicated. She laughs at something someone says, and the sound is light and uncomplicated, and I feel the burning start in my solar plexus.

*She has what I want. What I can never have.*

The party continues around me, but I'm frozen, every cell focused on this woman who represents everything I lack. She moves through the room with unconscious grace, collecting attention without trying, being loved without earning it.

*I hate her.*

The feeling is so intense it takes my breath away. Not because she's done anything to me—she hasn't. Not because she's taken anything from me—Marcus was already gone. But because looking at her is like looking at a mirror that shows only what's missing.

*She's complete. I'm a wound in search of a bandage.*

I drain my wine and get another. My friend David appears: "You okay?"

"Fine." The word comes out sharp. He doesn't push—he knows better.

I spend the next hour orbiting Clara like a dark moon. Watching. Cataloging. Every moment she seems happy, something in me burns hotter. Every time Marcus touches her arm, I fantasize about a hundred ways to make her disappear.

*If I can't have what she has, maybe I can take it from her.*

The thought shocks me, but only briefly. This is familiar territory: the competitive rage of the Sexual Four. The desire to possess or destroy whatever you lack. The conviction that wholeness exists outside yourself, in someone else's life, someone else's love, someone else's ease.

Eventually, I find myself in the bathroom, gripping the sink, staring at my own face in the mirror. My eyes are wild with an intensity that would frighten me if I weren't so used to it.

*What am I doing?*

Clara didn't steal my life. She's just living her own. The things she has—ease, lightness, belonging—aren't things she took from me. They're things I've never had, things I don't know how to have, things I've convinced myself are impossible for someone as deep and damaged as me.

*What if I'm not missing anything?*

The question arrives from somewhere unexpected. I turn it over in my mind, looking for the catch. All my life, I've felt incomplete. I've searched for the missing piece in lovers, in intensity, in the possession of what others have. And every time I've acquired it, the emptiness remained.

*What if the emptiness isn't because something was taken? What if it's because I've never really looked at what I have?*

The burning in my solar plexus begins to shift. Not disappear—but transform. The energy that was focused outward, on Clara, starts to turn inward. And for the first time, I see something other than deficiency.

I see passion. I see depth. I see a capacity for feeling that most people will never know. These aren't consolation prizes—they're gifts. Different from Clara's gifts, but no less real.

I leave the party without saying goodbye. The night air is cool on my flushed skin. I walk until the burning cools into something more bearable.

Clara will go home with Marcus. She'll have her easy, uncomplicated love. And I will have my intensity, my depth, my capacity to feel everything at maximum volume.

Maybe that's not worse. Maybe it's just different.

I don't know if I'll stop competing. The instinct is deep, and old, and fierce. But tonight, for one moment, I saw through it. I saw that the person I've been trying to destroy or possess was never really the enemy.

The enemy was the belief that I need something outside myself to be whole.

I am whole. Wounded and whole. Dark and whole. Missing nothing, needing nothing, complete.

The words don't feel true yet. But I'm going to keep saying them until they do.`,
    reflection: 'What qualities in others trigger your envy or competition? What would it mean to recognize that you already possess everything you need to be whole?'
