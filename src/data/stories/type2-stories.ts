    narrative: `The soup has been simmering for three hours. Chicken stock from scratch, vegetables from the farmers market, herbs from my own windowsill garden. It's for Michael, who mentioned last Tuesday that he was feeling under the weather.

He didn't ask for soup. He doesn't even know it's coming.

I ladle it into the container I bought specifically for this purpose—the kind that doesn't leak, the kind that says *I thought of everything*. My hands move with practiced care, and I feel the familiar warmth spreading through my chest. This is what I do. This is who I am.

But beneath the warmth, something else stirs. A hollowness in my stomach that has nothing to do with hunger. My own lunch sits untouched on the counter—I forgot to eat again.

*He'll be so grateful. He'll see how much I care.*

I catch the thought and feel a small twist of something uncomfortable. Is this soup for Michael, or is it for the look on Michael's face when he receives it?

I push the question away. I grab my coat. The container is heavy and warm against my chest as I walk the six blocks to his apartment.

He answers the door in sweatpants, hair messy, clearly fine. Not sick. Just tired from work, maybe. The Tuesday comment was probably nothing.

"Oh," he says, looking at the soup. "You didn't have to do that."

*But I did. I did have to do it. Don't you see?*

"It's nothing," I hear myself say. "I was making some anyway."

I wasn't. This soup was four hours of my Sunday. Four hours I could have spent on the project that's overdue, or calling my mother back, or sleeping—God, I'm so tired.

But I smile. I hand over the container. I wait.

"Thanks," Michael says. "That's really sweet." He takes the soup. He does not invite me in.

The door closes, and I stand in the hallway, feeling the hollowness expand. The warmth in my chest has cooled into something harder, something that feels dangerously close to resentment.

*I gave and gave and this is what I get?*

The thought shocks me with its bitterness. I love Michael. I wanted to help Michael. Why does this feel like a transaction that didn't balance?

I walk home slowly. My feet hurt. My stomach growls. On the corner, there's a café with a window seat bathed in late afternoon sun. I have walked past this café a hundred times, always on my way to someone else.

I stop.

*What do I need right now?*

The question feels foreign. Selfish. Wrong. But I ask it anyway, and my body answers before my mind can object: I need to sit down. I need to eat. I need to not be needed for one hour.

I push open the café door. I order soup—the irony isn't lost on me—and I sit in that window seat, sun warming my face.

The first spoonful is almost too much. Not the soup—the soup is ordinary—but the act of feeding myself. Of sitting with my own hunger and answering it. No one will thank me for this. No one will see how thoughtful I'm being.

Tears prick my eyes and I don't know why.

Maybe I do know why.

I have been so busy filling everyone else that I forgot I was empty. I learned early that my worth was in what I could give, and somewhere along the way, I lost the ability to receive—even from myself.

The soup grows cold. I order another. Outside, people pass by on their way to their own lives, their own needs, their own hungers.

For the first time in a long time, I am one of them. Just a person in a café, feeding herself, needing nothing from anyone.

It feels like the beginning of something.`,

    narrative: `The annual company retreat is in its second day, and I know exactly where everyone stands.

Robert, the CEO, is stressed about the board meeting next week—I can tell by the way he keeps checking his phone. Samira from marketing is feeling overlooked; she mentioned twice that her campaign results weren't acknowledged. David, the new VP, is nervous and trying too hard to impress.

I see all of this. I've always seen it. And I know exactly what each of them needs.

"Robert," I say, appearing at his elbow with a coffee prepared exactly how he likes it, "I pulled together those talking points for the board meeting. Just in case you need them."

His shoulders drop with relief. "What would I do without you, Grace?"

The warmth spreads through my chest like honey. This is my gift. I don't need the title or the corner office—I need to be essential. The person who makes everything work. The secret engine of other people's success.

During the breakout session, I make sure to pull Samira aside. "I thought your presentation was brilliant. I'm going to mention it to Robert." Her face lights up. Another thread secured.

At dinner, I'm seated—as always—at the main table. Not because of my role, but because I've positioned myself here through a thousand small kindnesses, a thousand moments of being exactly what was needed.

But tonight, something shifts.

I'm telling a story—one that makes Robert look good, naturally—when I catch sight of David at the end of the table. He's watching me with an expression I can't read. Not admiration. Not gratitude.

Understanding.

He sees what I'm doing.

The honey in my chest turns cold. I stumble over my words, recover, but the spell is broken. For the rest of dinner, I feel exposed. The warmth I usually generate feels artificial, and I can feel myself working—*performing*—in a way I never noticed before.

Back in my hotel room, I sit on the edge of the bed, heart racing. *He saw me.* The real me. The one who orbits power like a satellite, who measures her worth in proximity to important people, who doesn't know who she is outside of being needed.

*Who am I if I'm not the favorite?*

The question opens a void. I think about my mother, how she taught me that love was earned through usefulness, how being chosen was the only safety. I think about every inner circle I've clawed my way into, every powerful person whose needs I've anticipated, every relationship that felt like a chess move.

I am so tired.

The thought arrives like a whisper, and with it, tears. I am so tired of being indispensable. So tired of scanning every room for who matters, so tired of forgetting that I matter too.

I look at my phone. Samira texted: "Thank you for seeing me today. It meant a lot."

Something softens. Maybe I could just... be kind. Without strategy. Without positioning. Maybe kindness could be its own reward, untethered from the game I've been playing.

The next morning, I have breakfast alone. Not because I'm strategizing, but because I want to. I eat slowly. I don't scan the room.

Robert waves me over. For the first time, I wave back with a smile—and stay where I am.

"I'll catch up with you later," I call.

His surprise mirrors my own. But I stay in my seat, eating my eggs, practicing something new: being present without performing. Existing without earning.

It feels like learning to breathe with different lungs.

David walks by and nods. This time, his expression is something like respect.

I nod back. Two people, seeing each other clearly. It's terrifying.

It might also be the beginning of something real.`,

    narrative: `I see him the moment I walk into the gallery. Tall, distracted, studying a painting like it holds the answers to questions he hasn't learned to ask yet.

Something in my chest ignites. Not attraction—something deeper. Recognition. Opportunity.

*I could know him. I could become indispensable to him. I could make him need me in ways he doesn't even understand yet.*

I don't question the impulse. I never do. I move toward him like water flowing downhill, inevitable and purposeful.

"That piece is about loss," I say, stopping beside him. "The artist's father died before it was finished."

He turns. Blue eyes, a little sad. "I didn't know that."

"Most people don't." I smile—the smile I've perfected, the one that says *I see you and you're special*. "I'm Natasha."

Within twenty minutes, I know his name is James, he's recently divorced, he came to the gallery because his therapist suggested he try new things, and he doesn't know what he's looking for but he thinks he might recognize it if he sees it.

I become what he's looking for.

It's not manipulation—not exactly. It's more like... shape-shifting. I feel his energy, sense his wounds, and pour myself into the shape that will fit perfectly against his broken edges. I laugh at his hesitant jokes. I share carefully chosen vulnerabilities. I make him feel like the most interesting person in the room.

Because when he looks at me like I'm the answer, I feel alive.

We exchange numbers. We text for days—me, crafting each message like poetry; him, slowly opening like a flower toward my warmth. By the second date, he's telling me things he's never told anyone.

*He's falling. They always fall.*

But this time, something is different. Lying in bed after our first night together, watching him sleep, I feel the familiar warmth—and beneath it, an unexpected coldness. A hollowness.

*Who am I, if not who he needs me to be?*

I slipped into this character so seamlessly that I've lost track of where she ends and I begin. I told him I love jazz—I don't. I said I find his work fascinating—I was bored. I've been performing a version of myself that would make him love me, and now that he does...

I feel nothing.

No—worse than nothing. I feel trapped. Trapped in a persona I created, with a man who loves someone who doesn't exist.

The thought makes me want to run. It also makes me want to cling tighter, to try harder, to become even more perfect until the performance becomes real.

I slip out of bed and stand by the window. The city lights blur through tears I don't understand.

*What would happen if I showed him the real me?*

The question is terrifying because I don't know who that is. I've been adapting, seducing, becoming-what-is-needed for so long that I've lost the original. There's no Natasha underneath—just an endless series of reflections.

"Hey." James's voice, sleepy. "You okay?"

I could turn around with a smile. I could say I just needed some water. I could slip back into the character and let this play out the way it always does—intensity, then suffocation, then destruction.

Instead, I stay at the window.

"I don't actually like jazz," I say quietly. "I said I did because you do."

Silence. Then, "Okay..."

"I do that. A lot. Become what people want." My voice is barely a whisper. "I don't know who I am without it."

The bed creaks. He's coming toward me. I brace for rejection—for the disgust that surely follows when the illusion shatters.

His arms wrap around me from behind. Not possessive. Just... present.

"Then I guess we'll find out together," he says.

I don't know if this will work. I don't know if I can stop performing, if there's anything real underneath. But standing here in his arms, letting him hold someone he just met—the actual someone, not the constructed one—I feel something flicker.

It might be hope.

Or it might be the first breath I've taken without an agenda in years.

Either way, it's a beginning.`,
    reflection: 'When did you last reveal yourself without first calculating how it would be received? What would remain of you if you stopped adapting to be loved?'
