    narrative: `The dinner party invitation sits on my counter, unopened, for three days.

I know what's inside. My colleague Rachel wants me to meet her friends, to "get out more," to be the kind of person who enjoys Saturday nights surrounded by strangers making small talk about nothing.

I pick up the envelope. Put it down. The weight of the obligation makes my chest feel tight.

My apartment is quiet. Perfectly organized. Every book in its place, every surface clear, the lighting arranged for optimal reading. This is my castle—the place where no one can reach me, where I can finally stop performing the exhausting act of being a person in public.

*You should go,* whispers a voice that sounds like my mother. *Normal people don't hide on weekends.*

But the thought of going—of showering, dressing, driving, arriving, smiling, talking, pretending to care about people's jobs and vacations and children—makes me feel like something is being siphoned from my chest.

I do the calculation I always do: the energy required versus the energy available. The math doesn't work. A two-hour party will cost me a day of recovery. That's a day I could spend reading, researching, pursuing the questions that actually interest me.

*Sorry, can't make it,* I text Rachel. *Work thing.*

The lie comes easily. I've told it a hundred times. The relief is immediate—I feel my shoulders drop, my breathing deepen, the tension in my chest release.

But this time, something else follows: a flicker of something unexpected. Loneliness?

I push the feeling away and settle into my reading chair with a book on quantum entanglement. For three hours, I am content. My mind expands into vast, abstract spaces. I need nothing and no one.

Then I look up, and the apartment is dark. I haven't eaten. My phone shows no messages—I've trained people not to expect responses.

*Is this living?*

The question comes from somewhere I don't usually visit. I look around my castle—my beautiful, quiet, perfectly controlled castle—and for a moment, I see it differently. Not a sanctuary. A prison.

I built these walls to protect myself from the world's demands. But somewhere along the way, I walled myself in. The energy I was conserving has nowhere to go. The life I was protecting has grown small enough to fit in this room.

*What am I saving myself for?*

I think about my father, who died alone in an apartment not unlike this one. Who read brilliant books and had brilliant thoughts and never shared them with anyone. Who protected his energy so carefully that he never spent any of it on joy.

I don't want that. I don't want to die having hoarded a life I never lived.

But the alternative—going out, connecting, letting people in—feels impossible. The world is overwhelming. People are exhausting. The castle is all I know.

*Start small,* suggests a different voice. My own, maybe. Older. Kinder.

I pick up my phone. Text Rachel: *Actually, I can come for an hour. Just an hour.*

Sending it feels like jumping off a cliff. The anxiety rises immediately—already calculating the cost, already dreading the drain.

But something else rises too. A small, unfamiliar warmth. The recognition that maybe—just maybe—connection isn't only subtraction. Maybe it adds something too.

Rachel responds: *That's great! See you Saturday!*

I put down the phone. The apartment is still quiet. The books are still waiting. But something has shifted.

I am still a person who needs space, who finds the world depleting, who will never be comfortable in crowds. But maybe I don't have to choose between the castle and the world. Maybe there's a door I forgot existed. Maybe I can open it, just a crack, and see what comes in.

Saturday, I will go to the party. For one hour. I will talk to strangers about nothing important, and it will exhaust me, and I will come home to my quiet sanctuary and recover.

But I will have lived. Just a little.

Tonight, that feels like enough.`,

    narrative: `The conference Q&A has begun, and I'm waiting for my moment.

The speaker—Dr. Reeves—has just presented on climate modeling. His work is impressive, mostly correct, but flawed in ways only I can see. He's made assumptions about oceanic absorption rates that contradict the Sverdrup studies. He's overlooked the Hanson critique entirely.

My hand rises. The moderator calls on me.

"Thank you for the presentation. I noticed your model doesn't account for the thermal lag coefficient identified in Matsumoto's 2019 paper. Additionally, the absorption variables seem inconsistent with Sverdrup's revised data. Can you address these discrepancies?"

I deliver this calmly, precisely. I am not showing off. I am correcting an error. I am contributing to knowledge.

But as Dr. Reeves stumbles through a response, I feel the familiar glow in my chest—not warmth, exactly, but something like security. I have proven myself. I am the person who knows more. My place in this room is justified.

After the session, several people approach me. "Great question," they say. "You really know your stuff."

I nod, accept the praise, but I don't engage further. I've done my part. I've established my expertise. The social obligation has been fulfilled.

Walking back to my hotel, I replay the moment. The look on Dr. Reeves' face when he realized his mistake. The murmurs of respect in the audience. The confirmation that I am valuable—not as a person, but as a mind.

*This is how I belong.*

The thought arrives with unexpected weight. I stop on the sidewalk, suddenly aware of something I've been avoiding.

I am forty-three years old. I am respected in my field. My papers are cited, my opinions sought, my expertise unquestioned.

And I am profoundly, utterly alone.

Not physically alone—I have colleagues, acquaintances, people who nod at conferences and forward my emails. But actually alone. No one knows what I had for breakfast this morning. No one knows that I cry sometimes in hotel rooms. No one knows me as anything other than The Expert Who Knows Things.

*I traded connection for competence.*

The realization is sharp and uncomfortable. I built my entire identity around knowledge because knowledge felt safe. Knowledge didn't require vulnerability. Knowledge didn't risk rejection. If people valued me for what I knew, I could belong without having to actually show up as a person.

But here I am, successful and specialized and known, and I don't actually know anyone. Not really. My relationships are all transactional—I provide expertise, they provide validation.

*Is this what I wanted?*

I think about dinner tonight. The conference social. The room full of people who will want to talk about research and publications and nothing that matters. I could go and perform The Expert, collecting validation like tokens.

Or I could try something else.

The thought terrifies me. Without expertise, what do I have to offer? Who am I if not the person who knows things?

But the loneliness is pressing now, harder than usual. I'm tired of being respected. I want to be known.

At dinner, I sit next to a woman I don't recognize. Instead of asking about her research, I ask: "What made you want to do this work?"

She looks surprised. So am I.

"My grandmother," she says, after a moment. "She lived on a coast that's underwater now."

And we talk. Not about data or models or papers. About loss. About fear. About what drives us when we're not performing for conferences.

I share something too—something about my father, something I've never told a colleague. It feels dangerous. Exposed. Completely outside my area of expertise.

But when she puts her hand on my arm and says, "Thank you for telling me that," something shifts in my chest. Not security. Something warmer. Connection.

I don't know how to do this—being a person, not just an expert. But sitting here, having a conversation that doesn't prove anything, I think I might want to learn.

Tonight, I was more than my knowledge.

It wasn't comfortable. But it was real.`,

    narrative: `I am sitting across from Mira in her apartment, and I am more terrified than I have ever been in my life.

We have been dating for three months. She knows my coffee order, my opinions on consciousness studies, my favorite films. She does not know me.

Tonight, she asked me something no one has asked in years: "What do you actually feel? Not think—feel."

The question opened a trapdoor I've spent decades keeping locked.

"I don't know how to answer that," I said.

"Try," she said. And she waited.

Now I am sitting in this silence, heart pounding, and the walls of my inner castle are shaking. Inside that castle are rooms I've shown no one. Years of loneliness. Deep wells of need disguised as independence. A desperate longing to be seen that terrifies me precisely because it matters so much.

*If I show her and she leaves, I don't know if I'll survive it.*

Mira waits. She doesn't fill the silence with chatter or suggestions. She just waits, her presence steady, her eyes open.

"I feel..." I start, and my voice catches. "I feel like I've been alone inside a very beautiful prison my whole life. Like I built something intricate and complex and perfectly protected, and then realized I can't get out."

The words hang in the air. I can't look at her. I've said too much. I've exposed the need beneath the independence, the hunger beneath the detachment.

"What do you need right now?" she asks quietly.

*Everything. You. Someone to see all of it and stay.*

But I can't say that. Too vulnerable. Too much.

"I need you to not leave," I whisper instead. "Even though I just told you something I've never told anyone."

She moves closer. Not touching—she knows I need to control that—but close enough that I can feel her warmth.

"I'm not leaving," she says. "I'm right here."

Something in my chest cracks. Not breaks—cracks. A fissure in the wall I didn't know had any weakness.

"I have so much inside me," I say, and now I can't stop. "Ideas and feelings and observations and entire universes I've never shown anyone. I've been so afraid that if I opened it up, people would be overwhelmed. Or bored. Or they'd see that it's all I have—this inner world—and they'd leave."

"Can you show me?" Mira asks.

"What?"

"Your inner world. Can you show me?"

I laugh—a strange, choked sound. "It's not a museum. I can't just—"

"Start somewhere. Anything."

So I do. I tell her about the recurring dream I've had since childhood, the one with the library that goes on forever. I tell her about the theory I've never published because it's too speculative, too strange. I tell her about the way certain music makes me feel like I'm dissolving into something larger.

She listens. She asks questions. She doesn't flinch when it gets weird or abstract or too much.

An hour passes. Two. I am exhausted in a way I've never experienced—the exhaustion of actually being seen.

"This is you," she says finally. "The real you. Not the detached observer. This."

I nod. I can't speak.

"I like this version better," she says. "The one who feels things. The one who needs."

*The one who needs.* The words terrify me. But coming from her, they don't sound like weakness. They sound like humanness.

I reach for her hand—initiating touch, which I never do—and her fingers close around mine.

"This is hard for me," I say. "I don't know how to keep these doors open. I'll probably close them again."

"That's okay," she says. "I'll knock."

We sit there in the quiet, her hand in mine, my inner world exposed and raw and somehow still standing. I didn't combust. She didn't leave.

Maybe I don't need to share myself with everyone. Maybe I never did. But one person, the right person, who can enter my universe and find it home...

That might be everything.

For tonight, at least, I am not alone inside the castle.

Someone found the door.`,
